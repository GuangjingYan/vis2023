{"submissionId":"172zzu2","title":"Can't decide between DJI Osmo Action 4 and GoPro HERO12","topic":"Camera Reliability","abstract":"User feedback highlights a significant concern with GoPro camera reliability, particularly with the Hero10 and Hero11 models, where issues like SD card corruption and freezing have led to lost footage. Users compare GoPro with DJI's Action3 and Action4 cameras, noting that while GoPro may offer superior image quality and features, DJI excels in reliability and consistent performance without overheating or file corruption. The sentiment suggests that for users prioritizing dependability and a frustration-free experience, DJI is the preferred choice, despite GoPro's advanced capabilities and higher resolution. Additionally, discussions about editing apps and accessory compatibility indicate a broader ecosystem consideration in the user decision-making process.","comments":[{"body":"I‚Äôve been a GoPro user since the Hero6‚Ä¶\nUp to this date, my favorite was the Hero7, which is the only GoPro I still own.\n\nMy biggest problem with the GPs is general is the software reliability. The Hero10 was by far the worst experience ever. The freaking SD card corruption literally destroyed the user experience, and I lost count how many times I lost footage because of that. This got a lil better on the Hero11, but I got this error once.\n\nAnd not only this, it‚Äôs so frustrating when the quick shot does not work. You press the damn button and the camera does not turn on‚Ä¶ or when it‚Äôs recording and you press to turn off the camera freezes and force you to remove the battery‚Ä¶ most likely corrupting your footage‚Ä¶\n\nAll in one, the GP offers a much better ‚Äúcamera‚Äù, with higher resolution, better stability etc‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs pointless if these things are not working properly‚Ä¶ I mean‚Ä¶ the camera is supposed to work flawlessly all the time‚Ä¶ when it fails once it failed its purpose.\n\nAfter my also bad experience with the Hero11, I got an Action3 and boy what a difference.\nYes the image was not as good as the go pro but I was so damn happy. The camera was working flawlessly. You press to record and boom, it does. You press to stop and it does stop. No corrupted files‚Ä¶ no surprises.\n\nI recently got the Action4, that now offers 10Bit color (I like to grade my footage instead of using the full auto setting) and man image quality is superb. And the best part is that the camera freaking work as it should.\nBeing honest, I not even considered the Hero12‚Ä¶ \n\n\nMy summary is:\nIf you care most about image quality when using the full auto setting‚Ä¶ yes GoPro is the choice.\n\nIf you care about reliability and security that your camera will work every time you press the record button, DJI Osmo is the choice.\n\nBut know this: if you plan or like to grade your footage, and usually shoot using the pro settings, both cameras will give pretty the same image quality.","author":"TierryConstant","score":1,"parent_id":"t3_172zzu2","created_utc":1699921621.0,"created_date":"2023-11-14 00:27:01","replies":"[]","cluster":2,"x":1.0693618,"y":4.557183},{"body":"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1447142-REG/dji_pocketac_osmo_pocket_accessory_mount.html i use this with my pocket 2","author":"TrevMoMatic","score":1,"parent_id":"t1_k3zt0l6","created_utc":1698811520.0,"created_date":"2023-11-01 04:05:20","replies":"[]","cluster":1,"x":1.5373377,"y":5.0337925},{"body":"Not 2 Versions of the Camera.
